# Predicting Personality Traits from Steam Gameplay Behavior

Steam is an online video game community and marketplace. The steam system maintains detailed logs of user interactions, both on the site and during gameplay. The goal of this project is to explore how machine learning techniques can be used to leverage this logged information to model user personality traits, which could be used to provide more intelligent recommendations in the site's storefront or could be monitored overtime and possibly serve as early predictors for personality disorders like depresssion.

In this project specifically, I use Python's pandas and scikit learn libraries to scrape, clean, preprocess, and train an SVM classifier capable of predicting self-reported personailty traits. Further, I use R and the ggplot library to generate data visualizations. This repository contains the processing scripts used in the project, however note that the dataset has been omitted to maintain anonymity. 

This project was completed in the context of ML880, a graduate level machine learning course at the University of Saskatchewan. More information about the project background and outcomes can be found in the include PDF project report.
